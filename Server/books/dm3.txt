She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"
How long has this been goin' on? (on, on)
You been creepin' 'round on me (on me)
While you're callin' me "baby" (baby)
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady (shady)
I've been feelin' it lately (lately), baby
How long has this been goin' on? (ooh-ooh, yeah)
You've been creepin' 'round on me
How long has it been goin' on, baby? Oh (ooo-oh)
How long has this been goin' on? (You gotta go tell me now)
You've been actin' so shady (shady)
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
